# fairy_in_a_jar

WIP  

This project developed from a larger project where LEDs were controlled by an auxiliary music input using an Arduino Uno and a spectum analyzer shield by SparkFun.
In this project I wanted to minimize the form factor and simplify the components. Regarding the overall appearance I got some inspiration from **Gemi Michelle** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgufxIUwslw. So for the DIY of the fairy jar check out her video.

## Hardware

MCU: Arduino Nano
